Trac Installation Guide for 1.1
===============================

Trac is written in the Python programming language and needs a
database, `SQLite`_, `PostgreSQL`_, or `MySQL`_. For HTML rendering,
Trac uses the `Genshi`_ templating system.

Trac can also be localized, and there is probably a translation
available in your language. If you want to use the Trac interface in
other languages, then make sure you have installed the optional
package `Babel`_. Pay attention to the extra steps for localization
support in the `Installing Trac`_ section below. Lacking Babel, you
will only get the default English version.

If you're interested in contributing new translations for other
languages or enhancing the existing translations, then please have a
look at `TracL10N`_.

What follows are generic instructions for installing and setting up
Trac. While you may find instructions for installing Trac on specific
systems at `TracInstallPlatforms`_, please first read through these
general instructions to get a good understanding of the tasks
involved.

Dependencies
------------


Mandatory Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install Trac, the following software packages must be installed:


+ `Python`_, version >= 2.6 and < 3.0 (note that we dropped the
  support for Python 2.5 in this release)
+ `setuptools`_, version >= 0.6
+ `Genshi*`_, version >= 0.6


You also need a database system and the corresponding python bindings.
The database can be either SQLite, PostgreSQL or MySQL.


For the SQLite database
```````````````````````

As you must be using Python 2.6 or 2.7, you already have the SQLite
database bindings bundled with the standard distribution of Python
(the `sqlite3` module).

Optionally, you may install a newer version of `pysqlite`_ than the
one provided by the Python distribution. See `PySqlite*`_ for details.


For the PostgreSQL database
```````````````````````````

You need to install the database and its Python bindings:


+ `PostgreSQL`_, version 8.0 or later
+ `psycopg2`_, version 2.0 or later


See `DatabaseBackend`_ for details.


For the MySQL database
``````````````````````

Trac works well with MySQL, provided you follow the guidelines:


+ `MySQL`_, version 5.0 or later
+ `MySQLdb`_, version 1.2.2 or later


Given the caveats and known issues surrounding MySQL, read carefully
the `MySqlDb*`_ page before creating the database.


Optional Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Subversion
``````````

`Subversion`_, 1.6.x or later and the *corresponding* Python bindings.

There are `pre-compiled SWIG bindings`_ available for various
platforms. (Good luck finding precompiled SWIG bindings for any
Windows package at that listing. `TracSubversion`_ points you to
`Alagazam`_, which works for me under Python 2.6.)

For troubleshooting information, see the `TracSubversion*`_ page.

Note:


+ Trac doesn't use `PySVN`_, nor does it work yet with the newer
  `ctype`-style bindings.
+ If using Subversion, Trac must be installed on the same machine .
  Remote repositories are currently `not supported`_.


Git
```

`Git`_ 1.5.6 or later is supported. More information is available on
the `TracGit`_ page.


Other Version Control Systems
`````````````````````````````

Support for other version control systems is provided via third-party
plugins. See `PluginList#VersionControlSystems`_ and
`VersionControlSystem`_.


Web Server
``````````

A web server is optional because Trac is shipped with a server
included, see the `Running the Standalone Server`_ section below.

Alternatively you can configure Trac to run in any of the following
environments:


+ `Apache`_ with

    + `mod_wsgi`_, see `TracModWSGI`_ and `ModWSGI IntegrationWithTrac`_.
    + `mod_python 3.5.0`_, see `TracModPython`_

+ a `FastCGI`_-capable web server (see `TracFastCgi`_)
+ an `AJP`_-capable web server (see `TracOnWindowsIisAjp`_)
+ Microsoft IIS with FastCGI and a FastCGI-to-WSGI gateway (see `IIS
  with FastCGI`_)
+ a CGI-capable web server (see `TracCgi`_), but usage of Trac as a
  cgi script is highly discouraged , better use one of the previous
  options.


Other Python Packages
`````````````````````


+ `Babel*`_, version 0.9.6 or >= 1.3, needed for localization support
+ `docutils`_, version >= 0.3.9 for `WikiRestructuredText`_.
+ `Pygments`_ for `syntax highlighting`_.
+ `pytz`_ to get a complete list of time zones, otherwise Trac will
  fall back on a shorter list from an internal time zone implementation.


Attention : The available versions of these dependencies are not
necessarily interchangeable, so please pay attention to the version
numbers. If you are having trouble getting Trac to work, please
double-check all the dependencies before asking for help on the
`MailingList`_ or `IrcChannel`_.

Please refer to the documentation of these packages to find out how
they are best installed. In addition, most of the `platform-specific
instructions`_ also describe the installation of the dependencies.
Keep in mind however that the information there *probably concern
older versions of Trac than the one you're installing*.


Installing Trac
---------------

The `trac-admin`_ command-line tool, used to create and maintain
`project environments`_, as well as the `tracd`_ standalone server are
installed along with Trac. There are several methods for installing
Trac.


Using `easy_install`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trac can be installed from PyPI or the Subversion repository using
`setuptools`_.

A few examples:


+ Install Trac 1.0:

::

    easy_install Trac==1.0


+ Install latest development version:

::

    easy_install Trac==dev

  Note that in this case you won't have the possibility to run a
  localized version of Trac; either use a released version or install
  from source


More information can be found on the `setuptools*`_ page.

Setuptools Warning: If the version of your setuptools is in the range
5.4 through 5.6, the environment variable
`PKG_RESOURCES_CACHE_ZIP_MANIFESTS` must be set in order to avoid
significant performance degradation. More information may be found in
the sections on `Running The Standalone Server`_ and `Running Trac on
a Web Server`_.


Using `pip`
~~~~~~~~~~~

'pip' is an easy_install replacement that is very useful to quickly
install python packages. To get a Trac installation up and running in
less than 5 minutes:

Assuming you want to have your entire pip installation in
`/opt/user/trac`


  +

::

    pip install trac psycopg2 


or


  +

::

    pip install trac mysql-python 


Make sure your OS specific headers are available for pip to
automatically build PostgreSQL ( `libpq-dev`) or MySQL (
`libmysqlclient-dev`) bindings.

pip will automatically resolve all dependencies (like Genshi,
pygments, etc.), download the latest packages from pypi.python.org and
create a self contained installation in `/opt/user/trac`.

All commands ( `tracd`, `trac-admin`) are available in
`/opt/user/trac/bin`. This can also be leveraged for `mod_python`
(using `PythonHandler` directive) and `mod_wsgi` (using
`WSGIDaemonProcess` directive)

Additionally, you can install several Trac plugins (listed `here`_)
through pip.


From source
~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the python-typical setup at the top of the source directory also
works. You can obtain the source for a .tar.gz or .zip file
corresponding to a release (e.g. `Trac-1.0.tar.gz`) from the
`TracDownload`_ page, or you can get the source directly from the
repository. See `TracRepositories`_ for details.


::

    $ python ./setup.py install


*You will need root permissions or equivalent for this step.*

This will byte-compile the Python source code and install it as an
.egg file or folder in the `site-packages` directory of your Python
installation. The .egg will also contain all other resources needed by
standard Trac, such as `htdocs` and `templates`.

If you install from source and want to make Trac available in other
languages, make sure Babel is installed. Only then, perform the
`install` (or simply redo the `install` once again afterwards if you
realize Babel was not yet installed):


::

    $ python ./setup.py install


Alternatively, you can run `bdist_egg` and copy the .egg from `dist/`
to the place of your choice, or you can create a Windows installer (
`bdist_wininst`).


Using installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On Windows, Trac can be installed using the exe installers available
on the `TracDownload`_ page. Installers are available for the 32-bit
and 64-bit versions of Python. Make sure to use the installer that
matches the architecture of your Python installation.


Using package manager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trac may be available in your platform's package repository. Note
however, that the version provided by your package manager may not be
the latest release.


Advanced `easy_install` Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To install Trac to a custom location, or find out about other advanced
installation options, run:


::

    easy_install --help


Also see `Installing Python Modules`_ for detailed information.

Specifically, you might be interested in:


::

    easy_install --prefix=/path/to/installdir


or, if installing Trac on a Mac OS X system:


::

    easy_install --prefix=/usr/local --install-dir=/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages


Mac OS X Note: On Mac OS X 10.6, running `easy_install trac` will
install into `/usr/local` and `/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages` by
default.

The `tracd` and `trac-admin` commands will be placed in
`/usr/local/bin` and will install the Trac libraries and dependencies
into `/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages`, which is Apple's preferred
location for third-party Python application installations.


Creating a Project Environment
------------------------------

A `Trac environment`_ is the backend where Trac stores information
like wiki pages, tickets, reports, settings, etc. An environment is a
directory that contains a human-readable `configuration file`_, and
other files and directories.

A new environment is created using `trac-admin`_:


::

    $ trac-admin /path/to/myproject initenv


`trac-admin`_ will prompt you for the information it needs to create
the environment: the name of the project and the `database connection
string`_. If you're not sure what to specify for any of these options,
just press `<Enter>` to use the default value.

Using the default database connection string will always work as long
as you have SQLite installed. For the other `database backends`_ you
should plan ahead and already have a database ready to use at this
point.

Also note that the values you specify here can be changed later using
`TracAdmin`_ or directly editing the `conf/trac.ini`_ configuration
file.

Filesystem Warning: When selecting the location of your environment,
make sure that the filesystem on which the environment directory
resides supports sub-second timestamps (i.e. not `ext2` or `ext3` on
Linux, or HFS+ on OSX), as the modification time of the
`conf/trac.ini` file will be monitored to decide whether an
environment restart is needed or not. A too coarse-grained timestamp
resolution may result in inconsistencies in Trac < 1.0.2. The best
advice is to opt for a platform with sub-second timestamp resolution,
regardless of the Trac version.

Finally, make sure the user account under which the web front-end runs
will have write permissions to the environment directory and all the
files inside. This will be the case if you run `trac-admin ...
initenv` as this user. If not, you should set the correct user
afterwards. For example on Linux, with the web server running as user
`apache` and group `apache`, enter:


::

    $ chown -R apache:apache /path/to/myproject


The actual username and groupname of the apache server may not be
exactly `apache`, and are specified in the Apache configuration file
by the directives `User` and `Group` (if Apache `httpd` is what you
use).

Warning: Please only use ASCII-characters for account name and project
path, unicode characters are not supported there.


Deploying Trac
--------------


Running the Standalone Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After having created a Trac environment, you can easily try the web
interface by running the standalone server `tracd`_:


::

    $ tracd --port 8000 /path/to/myproject


Then, fire up a browser and visit `http://localhost:8000/`. You should
get a simple listing of all environments that `tracd` knows about.
Follow the link to the environment you just created, and you should
see Trac in action. If you only plan on managing a single project with
Trac you can have the standalone server skip the environment list by
starting it like this:


::

    $ tracd -s --port 8000 /path/to/myproject


Setuptools Warning: If the version of your setuptools is in the range
5.4 through 5.6, the environment variable
`PKG_RESOURCES_CACHE_ZIP_MANIFESTS` must be set in order to avoid
significant performance degradation. The environment variable can be
set system-wide, or for just the user that runs the `tracd` process.
There are several ways to accomplish this in addition to what is
discussed here, and depending on the distribution of your OS.

To be effective system-wide a shell script with the `export` statement
may be added to `/etc/profile.d`. To be effective for a user session
the `export` statement may be added to `~/.profile`.


::

    export PKG_RESOURCES_CACHE_ZIP_MANIFESTS=1


Alternatively, the variable can be set in the shell before executing
`tracd`:


::

    $ PKG_RESOURCES_CACHE_ZIP_MANIFESTS=1 tracd --port 8000 /path/to/myproject


Running Trac on a Web Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trac provides various options for connecting to a "real" web server:


+ `FastCGI*`_
+ `mod_wsgi*`_
+ `mod_python`_
+ *`CGI`_ (should not be used, as the performance is far from
  optimal)*


Trac also supports `AJP*`_ which may be your choice if you want to
connect to IIS. Other deployment scenarios are possible: `nginx`_,
`uwsgi`_, `Isapi-wsgi`_ etc.


Generating the Trac cgi-bin directory
`````````````````````````````````````

In order for Trac to function properly with FastCGI you need to have a
`trac.fcgi` file and for mod_wsgi a `trac.wsgi` file. These are Python
scripts which load the appropriate Python code. They can be generated
using the `deploy` option of `trac-admin`_.

There is, however, a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem. The `trac-
admin`_ command requires an existing environment to function, but
complains if the deploy directory already exists. This is a problem,
because environments are often stored in a subdirectory of the deploy.
The solution is to do something like this:


::

    mkdir -p /usr/share/trac/projects/my-project
    trac-admin /usr/share/trac/projects/my-project initenv
    trac-admin /usr/share/trac/projects/my-project deploy /tmp/deploy
    mv /tmp/deploy/* /usr/share/trac


Don't forget to check that the web server has the execution right on
scripts in the `/usr/share/trac/cgi-bin` directory.


Mapping Static Resources
````````````````````````

Out of the box, Trac will pass static resources such as style sheets
or images through itself. For anything but a tracd only based
deployment, this is far from optimal as the web server could be set up
to directly serve those static resources (for CGI setup, this is
highly undesirable and will cause abysmal performance).

Web servers such as `Apache`_ allow you to create “Aliases” to
resources, giving them a virtual URL that doesn't necessarily reflect
the layout of the servers file system. We also can map requests for
static resources directly to the directory on the file system,
avoiding processing these requests by Trac itself.

There are two primary URL paths for static resources -
`/chrome/common` and `/chrome/site`. Plugins can add their own
resources, usually accessible by `/chrome/<plugin>` path, so its
important to override only known paths and not try to make universal
`/chrome` alias for everything.

Note that in order to get those static resources on the filesystem,
you need first to extract the relevant resources from Trac using the
`TracAdmin`_ `deploy` command:

::

    deploy <directory>
    
        Extract static resources from Trac and all plugins
    


The target `<directory>` will then contain an `htdocs` directory with:


+ `site/` - a copy of the environment's directory `htdocs/`
+ `common/` - the static resources of Trac itself
+ `<plugins>/` - one directory for each resource directory managed by
  the plugins enabled for this environment


Example: Apache and `ScriptAlias`
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Assuming the deployment has been done this way:


::

    $ trac-admin /var/trac/env deploy /path/to/shared/trac


Add the following snippet to Apache configuration *before* the
`ScriptAlias` or `WSGIScriptAlias` (which map all the other requests
to the Trac application), changing paths to match your deployment:


::

    Alias /trac/chrome/common /path/to/trac/htdocs/common
    Alias /trac/chrome/site /path/to/trac/htdocs/site
    
    <Directory "/path/to/www/trac/htdocs">
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
    </Directory>


If using mod_python, you might want to add this too (otherwise, the
alias will be ignored):


::

    <Location "/trac/chrome/common/">
      SetHandler None
    </Location>


Note that we mapped the `/trac` part of the URL to the `trac.*cgi`
script, and the path `/trac/chrome/common` is the path you have to
append to that location to intercept requests to the static resources.

Similarly, if you have static resources in a project's `htdocs`
directory (which is referenced by `/trac/chrome/site` URL in themes),
you can configure Apache to serve those resources (again, put this
*before* the `ScriptAlias` or `WSGIScriptAlias` for the .*cgi scripts,
and adjust names and locations to match your installation):


::

    Alias /trac/chrome/site /path/to/projectenv/htdocs
    
    <Directory "/path/to/projectenv/htdocs">
      Order allow,deny
      Allow from all
    </Directory>


Alternatively to aliasing `/trac/chrome/common`, you can tell Trac to
generate direct links for those static resources (and only those),
using the ` [trac] htdocs_location`_ configuration setting:


::

    [trac]
    htdocs_location = http://static.example.org/trac-common/


Note that this makes it easy to have a dedicated domain serve those
static resources (preferentially `cookie-less`_).

Of course, you still need to make the Trac `htdocs/common` directory
available through the web server at the specified URL, for example by
copying (or linking) the directory into the document root of the web
server:


::

    $ ln -s /path/to/trac/htdocs/common /var/www/static.example.org/trac-common


Setting up the Plugin Cache
```````````````````````````

Some Python plugins need to be extracted to a cache directory. By
default the cache resides in the home directory of the current user.
When running Trac on a Web Server as a dedicated user (which is highly
recommended) who has no home directory, this might prevent the plugins
from starting. To override the cache location you can set the
`PYTHON_EGG_CACHE` environment variable. Refer to your server
documentation for detailed instructions on how to set environment
variables.


Configuring Authentication
--------------------------

Trac uses HTTP authentication. You'll need to configure your webserver
to request authentication when the `.../login` URL is hit (the virtual
path of the "login" button). Trac will automatically pick the
`REMOTE_USER` variable up after you provide your credentials.
Therefore, all user management goes through your web server
configuration. Please consult the documentation of your web server for
more info.

The process of adding, removing, and configuring user accounts for
authentication depends on the specific way you run Trac.

Please refer to one of the following sections:


+ `TracStandalone#UsingAuthentication`_ if you use the standalone
  server, `tracd`.
+ `TracModWSGI#ConfiguringAuthentication`_ if you use the Apache web
  server, with any of its front end: `mod_wsgi`, `mod_python`,
  `mod_fcgi` or `mod_fastcgi`.
+ `TracFastCgi`_ if you're using another web server with FCGI support
  (Cherokee, Lighttpd, LiteSpeed, nginx)


`TracAuthenticationIntroduction`_ also contains some useful
information for beginners.


Granting admin rights to the admin user
---------------------------------------

Grant admin rights to user admin:


::

    $ trac-admin /path/to/myproject permission add admin TRAC_ADMIN


This user will have an *Admin* navigation item that directs to pages
for administering your Trac project.


Configuring Trac
----------------

`TracRepositoryAdmin`_ provides information on configuring version
control repositories for your project.


Using Trac
----------

Once you have your Trac site up and running, you should be able to
create tickets, view the timeline, browse your version control
repository if configured, etc.

Keep in mind that *anonymous* (not logged in) users can by default
access only a few of the features, in particular they will have a
read-only access to the resources. You will need to configure
authentication and grant additional `permissions`_ to authenticated
users to see the full set of features.

*Enjoy!*

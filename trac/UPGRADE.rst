Instructions
------------

Typically, there are seven steps involved in upgrading to a newer
version of Trac:


1. Bring your server off-line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is not a good idea to update a running server: the server processes
may have parts of the current packages cached in memory, and updating
the code will likely trigger `internal errors`_.

Although a database backup will be implicitly created by default when
upgrading the environment, it is always a good idea to perform a full
backup of the environment using the `hotcopy`_ command before
beginning.


2. Update the Trac Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get the new version as described in `TracInstall`_, or your operating
system specific procedure.

If you already have a 0.12 version of Trac installed via
`easy_install`, it might be easiest to also use `easy_install` to
upgrade your Trac installation:


::

    easy_install --upgrade Trac==1.0


If you do a manual (not operating system-specific) upgrade, you should
also stop any running Trac servers before the installation. Doing
"hot" upgrades is not advised, especially on Windows (`#7265`_).

You may also want to remove the pre-existing Trac code by deleting the
`trac` directory from the Python `lib/site-packages` directory, or
remove Trac `.egg` files from former versions. The location of the
site-packages directory depends on the operating system and the
location in which Python was installed. However, the following
locations are typical:


+ on Linux: `/usr/lib/python2.X/site-packages`
+ on Windows: `C:\Python2.X\lib\site-packages`
+ on MacOSX: `/Library/Python/2.X/site-packages`


You may also want to remove the Trac `cgi-bin`, `htdocs`, `templates`
and `wiki-default` directories that are commonly found in a directory
called `share/trac`. The exact location depends on your platform. This
cleanup is not mandatory, but makes it easier to troubleshoot issues
later on, as your installation is uncluttered by code or templates
from a previous release that is not used anymore. As usual, make a
backup before actually removing things.


3. Upgrade the Trac Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Environment upgrades are not necessary for minor version releases
unless otherwise noted.

After restarting, Trac should show the instances which need a manual
upgrade via the automated upgrade scripts to ease the pain. These
scripts are run via `trac-admin`_:


::

    trac-admin /path/to/projenv upgrade


This command will do nothing if the environment is already up-to-date.

Note that a backup of your database will be performed automatically
prior to the upgrade. This feature is relatively new for PostgreSQL or
MySQL databases, so if it fails, you will have to backup the database
manually. Then, to perform the actual upgrade, run:


::

    trac-admin /path/to/projenv upgrade --no-backup


4. Update the Trac Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, every `Trac environment`_ includes a copy of the Trac
documentation for the installed version. However, to keep the included
documentation in sync with the installed version of Trac, use the
following `trac-admin`_ command to upgrade the documentation:


::

    trac-admin /path/to/projenv wiki upgrade


Note that this procedure will leave your `WikiStart` page intact.


5. Refresh static resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have set up a web server to give out static resources directly
(accessed using the `/chrome/` URL) then you will need to refresh them
using the same command:


::

    trac-admin /path/to/env deploy /deploy/path


this will extract static resources and CGI scripts ( `trac.wsgi`, etc)
from new Trac version and its plugins into `/deploy/path`.

Some web browsers (IE, Opera) cache CSS and Javascript files
aggressively, so you may need to instruct your users to manually erase
the contents of their browser's cache, a forced refreshed ( `<F5>`)
should be enough.


6. Steps specific to a given Trac version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Upgrading from Trac 1.0 to 1.1.x
````````````````````````````````


Python 2.5 no longer supported
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Upgrade Python to at least 2.6, but not 3.0.


New workflow actions
++++++++++++++++++++

The ticket creation step is now controlled with a workflow action. The
default workflow has `create` and `create_and_assign` actions. The
`create` action will always be added when upgrading the database. The
`create_and_assign` action will be added if the workflow has an
*assigned* state. You may want to edit your workflow after upgrading
the database to customize the actions available on the *New Ticket*
page.


New permissions policy for read-only wiki pages
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Since 1.1.2 the read-only attribute of wiki pages is enabled and
enforced only when `ReadonlyWikiPolicy` is in the list of active
permission policies. If `[trac] permission_policy` has the default
value `DefaultPermissionPolicy, LegacyAttachmentPolicy`, then
`ReadonlyWikiPolicy` should be automatically appended to the list when
upgrading the environment:


::

    [trac]
    permission_policies = ReadonlyWikiPolicy,
     DefaultPermissionPolicy,
     LegacyAttachmentPolicy


If other permission policies are enabled, *trac.ini* will need to be
edited to append `ReadonlyWikiPolicy` to the list of active
`permission_policies`. See
`TracFineGrainedPermissions#ReadonlyWikiPolicy`_ for additional
details on the proper ordering.


Upgrading from Trac 0.12 to Trac 1.0
````````````````````````````````````


Python 2.4 no longer supported
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Upgrade Python to at least 2.5, but not 3.0.


Subversion components not enabled by default for new installations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The Trac components for Subversion support are no longer enabled by
default. To enable the svn support, you need to make sure the
`tracopt.versioncontrol.svn` components are enabled, for example by
setting the following in the `TracIni`_:


::

    [components]
    tracopt.versioncontrol.svn.* = enabled


The upgrade procedure should take care of this and change the
`TracIni`_ appropriately, unless you already had the svn components
explicitly disabled.


Attachments migrated to new location
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Another step in the automatic upgrade will change the way the
attachments are stored. Create a backup of the `attachments` directory
before upgrading. In case the `attachments` directory contains some
files which are *not* attachments, the last step of the migration to
the new layout will fail: the deletion of the now unused `attachments`
directory can't be done if there are still files and folders in it.
You may ignore this error, but better to move them elsewhere and
remove the `attachments` directory manually. The attachments
themselves are now all located in your environment below the
`files/attachments` directory.


Behavior of `[ticket] default_owner` changed
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Prior to 1.0, the owner field of new tickets always defaulted to
`[ticket] default_owner` when the value was not empty. If the value
was empty, the owner field defaulted to to the Component's owner. In
1.0 and later, the `default_owner` must be set to `< default >` to
make new tickets default to the Component's owner. This change allows
the `default_owner` to be set to an empty value if no default owner is
desired.


Upgrading from Trac 0.11 to Trac 0.12
`````````````````````````````````````


Python 2.3 no longer supported
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The minimum supported version of Python is now 2.4.


SQLite v3.x required
++++++++++++++++++++

SQLite v2.x is no longer supported. If you still use a Trac database
of this format, you'll need to convert it to SQLite v3.x first. See
`PySqlite#UpgradingSQLitefrom2.xto3.x`_ for details.


`PySqlite`_ 2 required
++++++++++++++++++++++

`PySqlite`_ 1.1.x is no longer supported. Please install 2.5.5 or
later if possible, see `Trac database upgrade`_ below.


Multiple Repository Support
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The latest version includes support for multiple repositories. If you
plan to add more repositories to your Trac instance, please refer to
`TracRepositoryAdmin#Migration`_.

This may be of interest to users with only one repository, since there
is now a way to avoid the potentially costly resync check at every
request.


Resynchronize the Trac Environment Against the Source Code Repository
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Each `Trac environment`_ must be resynchronized against the source
code repository in order to avoid errors such as "`No changeset ??? in
the repository`_" while browsing the source through the Trac
interface:


::

    trac-admin /path/to/projenv repository resync '*'


Improved repository synchronization
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In addition to supporting multiple repositories, there is now a more
efficient method for synchronizing Trac and your repositories.

While you can keep the same synchronization as in 0.11 adding the
post-commit hook as outlined in `TracRepositoryAdmin#Synchronization`_
and `TracRepositoryAdmin#ExplicitSync`_ will allow more efficient
synchronization and is more or less required for multiple
repositories.

Note that if you were using the `trac-post-commit-hook`, *you're
strongly advised to upgrade it* to the new hook documented in the
above references and `here`_, as the old hook will not work with
anything else than the default repository and even for this case, it
won't trigger the appropriate notifications.


Authz permission checking
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The authz permission checking has been migrated to a fine-grained
permission policy. If you use authz permissions (aka `[trac]
authz_file` and `authz_module_name`), you must add `AuthzSourcePolicy`
in front of your permission policies in `[trac] permission_policies`.
You must also remove `BROWSER_VIEW`, `CHANGESET_VIEW`, `FILE_VIEW` and
`LOG_VIEW` from your global permissions with `trac-admin $ENV
permission remove` or the "Permissions" admin panel.


Microsecond timestamps
++++++++++++++++++++++

All timestamps in database tables, except the `session` table, have
been changed from "seconds since epoch" to "microseconds since epoch"
values. This change should be transparent to most users, except for
custom reports. If any of your reports use date/time columns in
calculations (e.g. to pass them to `datetime()`), you must divide the
values retrieved from the database by 1'000'000. Similarly, if a
report provides a calculated value to be displayed as a date/time
(i.e. with a column named "time", "datetime", "changetime", "date",
"created" or "modified"), you must provide a microsecond timestamp,
that is, multiply your previous calculation with 1'000'000.


Upgrading from Trac 0.10 to Trac 0.11
`````````````````````````````````````


Site Templates and Styles
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The templating engine has changed in 0.11 to Genshi, please look at
`TracInterfaceCustomization`_ for more information.

If you are using custom CSS or modified templates in the `templates`
directory of the `TracEnvironment`_, you will need to convert them to
the Genshi way of doing things. To continue to use your style sheet,
follow the instructions at
`TracInterfaceCustomization#SiteAppearance`_.


Trac Macros, Plugins
++++++++++++++++++++

The Trac macros will need to be adapted, as the old-style wiki-macros
are not supported anymore due to the drop of `ClearSilver`_ and the
HDF. They need to be converted to the new-style macros, see
`WikiMacros`_. When they are converted to the new style, they need to
be placed into the plugins directory instead and not wiki-macros,
which is no longer scanned for macros or plugins.


For FCGI/WSGI/CGI users
+++++++++++++++++++++++

For those who run Trac under the CGI environment, run this command in
order to obtain the trac.*gi file:


::

    trac-admin /path/to/env deploy /deploy/directory/path


This will create a deploy directory with the following two
subdirectories: `cgi-bin` and `htdocs`. Then update your Apache
configuration file `httpd.conf` with this new `trac.cgi` location and
`htdocs` location.


Web Admin plugin integrated
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you had the `WebAdmin`_ plugin installed, you can uninstall it as
it is part of the Trac code base since 0.11.


New Default Configurable Workflow
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When you run `trac-admin <env> upgrade`, your `trac.ini` will be
modified to include a `[ticket-workflow]` section. The workflow
configured in this case is the original workflow, so that ticket
actions will behave like they did in 0.10.

Graphically, that looks like this:
Enable JavaScript to display the workflow graph.
There are some significant caveats in this, such as accepting a ticket
sets it to 'assigned' state, and assigning a ticket sets it to 'new'
state. So you will probably want to migrate to "basic" workflow;
`contrib/workflow/migrate_original_to_basic.py`_ may be helpful. See
`TracWorkflow`_ for a detailed description of the new basic workflow.


7. Restart the Web Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are not running `CGI`_, reload the new Trac code by restarting
your web server.


Known Issues
------------


Customized Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trac supports customization of its Genshi templates by placing copies
of the templates in the `<env>/templates` folder of your
`environment`_ or in a common location specified in the ` [inherit]
templates_dir`_ configuration setting. If you choose to do so, be
aware that you will need to repeat your changes manually on a copy of
the new templates when you upgrade to a new release of Trac (even a
minor one), as the templates will likely evolve. So keep a diff
around.

The preferred way to perform `TracInterfaceCustomization`_ is to write
a custom plugin doing an appropriate `ITemplateStreamFilter`
transformation, as this is more robust in case of changes: we usually
won't modify element `id`s or change CSS `class`es, and if we have to
do so, this will be documented in the `TracDev/ApiChanges`_ pages.


ZipImportError
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Due to internal caching of zipped packages, whenever the content of
the packages change on disk, the in-memory zip index will no longer
match and you'll get irrecoverable ZipImportError errors. Better
anticipate and bring your server down for maintenance before
upgrading. See `#7014`_ for details.


Wiki Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~

`trac-admin` will not delete or remove default wiki pages that were
present in a previous version but are no longer in the new version.


Trac database upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A known issue in some versions of `PySqlite`_ (2.5.2-2.5.4) prevents
the trac-admin upgrade script from successfully upgrading the database
format. It is advised to use either a newer or older version of the
sqlite python bindings to avoid this error. For more details see
ticket `#9434`_.


Parent dir
~~~~~~~~~~

If you use a Trac parent env configuration and one of the plugins in
one child does not work, none of the children will work.

--------------


Upgrading Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upgrading Python to a newer version will require reinstallation of
Python packages: Trac itself of course, but also `easy_install`_, if
you've been using that. If you are using Subversion, you'll also need
to upgrade the Python bindings for svn.


Windows and Python 2.6
``````````````````````

If you've been using CollabNet's Subversion package, you may need to
uninstall that in favor of `Alagazam`_, which has the Python bindings
readily available, see `TracSubversion`_. That package works without
tweaking.


Changing Database Backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `TracMigratePlugin`_ on `trac-hacks.org`_ has been written to
assist in migrating between SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.


Upgrading from older versions of Trac
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For upgrades from versions older than Trac 0.10, refer first to
`wiki:0.10/TracUpgrade#SpecificVersions`_.
